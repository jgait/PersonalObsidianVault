# Tufte's Rules (For Good Graphics)

**Lie factor** - Keep close to 1.0. Relative representation of numbers as represented on the graph spatially should match the true relative change in the data.
$$ \text{Lie Factor} = \frac{\text{size of the effect in the graphic}}{\text{size of the effect in the data}}$$
