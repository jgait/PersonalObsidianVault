## System Performance Requirements
**A. Travel time of 300ms for 1 meter of distance** 
*Justification:* The ability to traverse the entire stiffness range in less than one swing phase

**B. Ability to move from min to infinite with a fully loaded dynamic platform**
*Justification:* Allows for satisfactory system performance in all loading cases

**C. Linear Position accuracy and repeatability of sub 0.25Â mm**
*Justification:* This corresponds to a stiffness change of ----- at a starting stiffness of 30 kN/m

## Motion Profile Selection
To satisfy the 1 meter of travel in 300ms requirement, a **triangular motion profile** will be used. From this motion profile, critical parameters such as minimum acceleration emerge. The triangular motion profile minimizes the required acceleration, allowing for a more compact motor and less system load.
