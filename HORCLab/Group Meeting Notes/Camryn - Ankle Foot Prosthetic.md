### Notes:
- Spring Active Ankle Optimal weight Range -> 80-100kg

### Questions:
- How does losing the knee affect the gait


### Feedback:
Summary
Camryn has been able to adapt the Spring Active ankle to the iWalk support to create an inline prosthetic simulator. It's a bit tricky to walk with but seems to allow for a more useful gait than the side adapter does. She will be working to run a pilot study in the coming weeks.

Good
- Nice photos, I like the backgrounds removed!
- Concise quick presentation

Great presentation with clear speaking. The photos with the backgrounds removed were very nice! Great job answering questions, you said I don't know at the right times. I look forward to seeing how things go. Great job!

Bad
I would have liked to have seen the point about the missing knee joint addressed somewhere in the methods. It seems like a significant issue to me.
