Learning based controller for locomotion over compliant terrain
# Notes
- Gait pattern slide intro was a little rough, odd transition (Why does it matter?)
- missed the transition from liturature to your work "The gap"
- Do we need to see all the DH stuff? Could it be condensed?
- Slide 15 graph is kinda whack
- Slide 19 what is the restitution? Stiffness?
- Slide 26 what do these graphs mean why is this valuable?'
- What quantifies success
- Slide 29 maybe convert the ILD to a more traditional stiffness measure?
- Slide 31 said "0.02 m/s" for the angular velocity, is it m/s or rad/s?
