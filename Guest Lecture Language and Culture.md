# What is language
**Guest speaker def** - A system of human communication composed of vocabulary and grammar

Do animals have language or simply communication?

**What is a separate language**
- People generally understand each other 
- People agree they are speaking the same language 

This is a purely linguistic definition, however it gets far more complex on the culture side
# Language in a cultural context
Language is a lot more than that. It represents our traditions values modes of expression religions and all other aspects that comprise our cultures

Culture is carried and spread through language

| High Context                           | Low Context                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Establish social trust first           | Get down to business                             |
| Value personal relations and good will | Value Expertise and Performance                  |
| Agreement by trust                     | Agreements are specific, legalistic, by contract |
| Negotiations are slow and ritualistic  | Negotiations are efficient                       |

English speakers generally have a low context culture

Fairness is a trait more seen in low context cultures. This arises due to the value placed in relationships

# High Context Cultures

There is an emergent global culture that relies on English to communicate 
People from non English speaking countries often have two cultures, their local home culture and their global culture

Is the global culture mostly shaped by English culture or is it an amalgam 

Does changes in levels of context explain why newenglanders are more cold than southerners
