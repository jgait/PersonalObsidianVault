Potential conflicts
- personal advancements, career growth and decisions based on that might be perceived as selfish
- How quality work is rewarded, team vs individual
- Differences in compromising because of differences in value of company vs individual (working hours, how much you work)
- Work is primary component in individualist society, while family holds more importance 

How to adjust
- being willing to adapt
- Being self aware
- Trying to learn some about the place we are relocating too before we go there
- learning local customs, languages, and cultural values
- communicate openly about it (work distribution, feelings of being undervalued)
