A Gaussian process is a collections of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint multivariate Gaussian distribution. The Gaussian process is specified by:

>**Mean Function**
>- Conveys the mean of the process

>**Co-Variance Function**
>- Captures the variability around the mean

The covariance function is captured in a kernel matrix that describes the co-variance between a parameter (variable) and every other parameter (variable)
