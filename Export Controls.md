**Def:** Export controls refer to the laws that govern the movement of controlled information and objects around the world 

**EAR** -> aka. Export Administration Regulations
> The EAR (15 CFR 734.13) define **export** as, "an actual shipment or transmission of items out of the United States." This also includes “releasing” or transferring items. Many individuals often think that the term “export” only covers the overseas shipment of an item in a box. While this is one example of an export, you can also export an item visually, auditorily, verbally, and electronically.

**Export "Release"**
>Technology is "released" for export when: it is available to foreign persons for visual or other inspection (such as reading technical specifications, plans, or blueprints); technology is exchanged orally or in writing; or technology or software, through "access information," is made available (15 CFR 734).

Note: An export can occur inside or outside the US
