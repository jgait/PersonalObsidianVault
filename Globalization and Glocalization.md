##### Def - Globalization
> The worldwide diffusion of practices; the process of international integration arising from the interchange of world views product ideas and other aspects of [[Culture]]
> 
> **Example:** Proliferation of Coca-Cola and Starbucks around the world. Creates an odd hybrid of the local themes and brand themes. Critically, the product looks the same, just in a new place. 

##### Def - Glocalization
> The interpenetration of the global and local; focusing on the uniqueness and differences within and in between areas of the world 
> 
> **Example:** McDonald’s food being modified to meet the needs of Hindu Practitioners in India with a chicken Big Mac. Core idea, the company adjusts to the local [[Culture]]

### Case Study - Euro Disney to Disney Paris
![[Pasted image 20230907114036.png|250]]
Disney entered into the European market in Paris as Disney Euro in 1992, and utterly failed. They lost 2.8 billion dollars due to **failure to glocalize**. 
1. There is independent culture between different European countries
3. The resort kept its “Americanism” and was not appealing as a destination in France
4. Europeans going to Disney Euro did not want to spend many days there
5. All sorts of cultural clash problems in HR (Brainwashing, short lunch, bad hours)
