**Numerical**: Number associated values
**Categorical**: Tags and categories

**Review Book** → Introduction to statistics: An interactive E-Book
# Probability
A level of certainty that some event will happen

**In the basic interpretation, the game is frequentist**
- Relates to the fractional probability that something will happen
- Fully covered by and/or statements
- Max probability is 1 and every possibility has a complement
- Disjoint → events are independent of each other (separate throws of coin)
- Dependent events → events are dependent on one another

# Statistics 
Takes us from observing a limited data set to making predictions beyond the data
##### **Def** - Sample
>A finite subset of the population that is observed
##### **Def** - Population
>All the elements of a family

Statistics infers about the population via observations of the sample
## Law of large numbers
As the size of a sample tends to infinity, the mean of the samples tends to population

## Descriptive Statistics
No models, no hypothesis, we are just describing things

**Important to know**
- Central Tendency: mean, median, mode
- Spread: variance interquantile range

### Probability Distributions
Most distributions are continuous, giving the statement "What is the probability of getting a specific number" no meaning. Distributions are always binned or bounded by equalities 

**Moments of a distribution** → parameters that describe the distribution

Sigma values quantify the probability you are right. one sigma = 68%
