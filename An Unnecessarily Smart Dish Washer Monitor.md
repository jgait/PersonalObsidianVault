#MachineLearning #VideoWorthy
## Brief
Knowing whether the dishwasher is currently clean or dirty is an age old problem. What if we took the dumb dishwasher flip sign that says whether the dishwasher is clean or dirty and shoved smarts inside. By pointing a camera at the dishwasher and then feeding the output to a video classifier paired with some state logic we can figure out if the dish washer is clean or dirty

A dishwasher has a clearly defined cyclical process, by classifying events in the video we can advance through this cycle
