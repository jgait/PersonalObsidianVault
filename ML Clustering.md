Clustering is unsupervised learning method where we group elements together based on some similarity function
## Criterion
**Internal Criterion** - members of a cluster should be similar to each other (intra cluster compactness)
**External Criterion** - objects outside the group should not be similar to those in the group

## But how do you find similarity
This is the central question and varies based on the context and use case. This is the distance function between data. Distances could include

Color
Shape

## Optimization of Distance
**Jaccard similarity** measures the overlap of ground truth and predicted area by dividing the overlap of the regions by the union of the regions
