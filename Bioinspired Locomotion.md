# Seed Dispersal
Seed dispersal is a big thing for plant success. Thus plants have evolved ways of getting their seeds far away

**Methods**
- Using available fluids (Water, Wind)
- Animals
- Preloaded energy (Explosions!)

**Wind Induced**
> Helicopter Seeds - Autorotation induced by shape
> Dandelions - 4x more efficient than a parachute

**Explosive Induced**
> Exploding Cucumber - Loads bunches of fluid into the container and then boom

# Animal Locomotion

### Aerial
Things that fly/glide (Birds, Lizards, Squirrels, etc...)

> **Lift** --> is always *perpendicular* to the incoming air speed

Flying animals come in a wide range of sizes
--> Different scales of fliers fly differently due to aerodynamic effects

## Aquatic
Like flying but no need to deal with lift
