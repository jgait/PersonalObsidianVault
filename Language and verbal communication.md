**Sociolinguistics**
*Key idea* -> Accent, phrasing and word usage are associated with class differences in a society

**Linguistic profiling** - occurs when a person is denied access to otherwise available good  or services by phone, sight unseen, based exclusively on the sound of their voice. [Ted talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjFtIg-nLAA)
# High Context Cultures
- **Non Verbal cultural aspects are important**
- Language transmits little of explicit message
- Restricted code
> Speech coding system of high context languages
> Language reflects the social standing of individuals

# Low Context Cultures
- explicit message
- May be given in more than one way to assure understanding

Culture is carried and spread through language

| High Context                           | Low Context                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Establish social trust first           | Get down to business                             |
| Value personal relations and good will | Value Expertise and Performance                  |
| Agreement by trust                     | Agreements are specific, legalistic, by contract |
| Negotiations are slow and ritualistic  | Negotiations are efficient                       |

**English** speakers generally have a **low context** culture

In a high context culture, the idea of directly saying no is taboo and avoided
