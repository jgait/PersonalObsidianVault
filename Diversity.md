Washington Post, how diverse is America 

The United States has always been called the melting pot of America however, this carries the implicit message that [[culture|cultural]] assimilation is necessary in America

	Examples:
	East Asian immigrants switching from chopstick to spoon
	Immigrants converting to Christianity

**Cultural Assimilation**, When an individual adopts aspects of the characteristics of a dominant culture. It is sometimes the result of cultural imperialism or forced assimilation, but can also be and often is voluntary 

##### Renaming the melting pot
Some propose the use of “Salad Bowl” instead of the typical “melting pot” Analogy due to the more heterogeneous mix present in a salad
