## [[Convection]] driven by buoyancy
Hot air is less dense -> causes a rising flow
![[Rising Natural Convection.png|200]]

Cold air is more dense -> causes a falling flow
![[Falling Natural Convection.png|200]]
## Grashof Num
Ratio of buoyancy forces to Viscous forces

$Gr_L=\frac{ \beta (T_s-T_\infty)L_c^3}{v^2}$

When > 10^9 the flow is turbulent on flat plate

## Nusselt Number Correlations
$Nu=\frac{hL_c}{k}=C(Gr_LPr^n)=CRa^{n}_L$

Where $Ra$ is the Rayleigh number $Ra=GrPr$
Specific nusselt correlations vary based on the physical situation

## applications
1. Ideal fin spacing - More fins decrease airflow, less fins decrease q

## Forced vs free convection 
Ratio of grashof num to Reynolds num tells us about whether forced or free convection dominates

$Gr/Re^2$

When > 1 free convection dominates 
When < 1 forced convection dominates
When between 0.1 and 10 convection is mixed

## Combined Flow (Forced and Free)
