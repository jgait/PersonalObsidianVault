#HeatTransfer 
Phase change convection is the process of a material switching phases resulting in [[Convection]]

# Boiling
Occurs when Ts > Tsat for the given fluid
$q_{boil}=h T_{excess}$  Where $T_{excess} = T_s - T_{sat}$

### Pool Boiling
![[Stationary Boiling.png|200]]
	Stationary
	Natural Free Convection 
	Eg. Boiling soup

### Flow Boiling

	Moving
	Closed flow
	Eg. Boiler

## Boiling curve

Interestingly, rate of heat transfer does not just increase with temperature difference 
better boiling performance down at the lower temp end (pre max critical point)
Above the Critical point, the boiling is less efficient 


## Applications 
- Increases h in a convection situation (boiling/condensation h >> [[Natural Convection]]/forced h)
- Allows for const-temp in a fluid as pressure changes

# Condensation 
Reverse process of boiling -> vapor condenses onto colder surface

Unexpectedly, greater heat transfer occurs under droplet condensation due to the
