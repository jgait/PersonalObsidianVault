# What Is Data Science
**Def - Data Science**
> Application of coding and statistics to discover something about a data set
> The intersection of statistics, coding, and natural science knowledge

Data science requires a robust understanding of the context in which a data scientist works

## Reproducibility
Data science work must be made reproducible. Anyone must be able to replicate exactly the work you did. All numbers in data science can be recalculated exactly (down to stochastic variables).

**What this means for us:**
- Use open data
- Set your python seeds (the seed for the random number generators)
