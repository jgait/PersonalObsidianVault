### Why Compliant?
- Nature is squishy
- Nature creates movement with compliance and muscles while engineers create movement with rigid parts and constant motion

Nature has not evolved a way for continuous rotation, mostly rely on *joints with muscle driven periodic motion* for movement. This is starkly different from bearing, gears, and rigid material

**Thoughts**
>It all feels heavily related to the ability to grow, it is hard to grow a disconnected revolute joint but it is easy to grow a flexy connection
